These same principles can also be used to derive the values for the other half of the unit circle. But then you would subtract $\pi$ in the third quadrant and $1 \frac{1}{2} \pi$ in the last quadrant, instead of the $\frac{1}{2} \pi$ in the second quadrant or no subtraction in the first. Again, from that it follows that we have $x= - \frac{1}{2}$ and $y=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
